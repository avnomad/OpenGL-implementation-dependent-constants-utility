This is a small program which queries and displays the values of a number of 
OpenGL state variables that have constant, implementation-dependent values.
Thus the output will probably make sense only to OpenGL developers.
It covers implementation-dependent values of all the versions up to 3.1.

This program is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 which
can be found in license.txt.

It needs freeglut and glew libraries installed to compile and run.
It also needs gawk to compile.
The above components need to be downloaded and installed separately.

You can find freeglut and glew at http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php and
http://glew.sourceforge.net/ respectively.
gawk will probably be preinstalled on linux and can be found at the following
url for windows: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm.

In the bin folder you can find a number of precompiled binaries for different
platforms.

In the src folder you will find both a visual studio solution and a makefile to
compile the program, plus additional information to help you modify it.
