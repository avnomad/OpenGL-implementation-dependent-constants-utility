The lines corresponding to OpenGL state variables normally have 3 fields. Except
those about the convolution filters and the occlusion queries that have 4.

Yet some of the first lines have 2 redundant fields. These fields, 4 and 5,
contain the major and minor number of the version this state variable first 
appeared. They may not be accurate and are ignored by the current script.



The gawk of ubuntu exhibits slightly different behavior than the one for 
windows. First $0 contains 1 more character after the last of the line. I 
haven't figured out yet if it's a \r from the file being created in windows or
the \n itself. Second every line needs to be ended with a tab (the field 
separator) or else the last field will not be read correctly. It is possible
that the above extra character is also appended to the last field. I haven't
really looked into the matter. For now anyone who might change table.txt should
remember to end each line with a tab. Those who will compile the project on 
windows can safely ignore this paragraph.
